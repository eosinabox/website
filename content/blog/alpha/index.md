#Limited time, ALPHA testing
##Absolutely no warranty

An extremely unreliable experiment, with some sloppy code that will let you start a private blockchain you control and own all the resources on. It has 4 Block Producer nodes and one API node.

Want to experiment with your very own blockchain and see if you like it?
Head over to <a href="http://chartly.com">chartly.com</a>, just an old domain I had lying around...
