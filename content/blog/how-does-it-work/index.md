Starting a new blockchain requires knowledge in many different fields and there are lots of decisions to be made along the way. Don't get that discourage you, eosinabox is here to help. Setting up a private blockchain can be done by developers who know how to set up a linux server stack for a regular web app. I'm writing a long checklist of things to do, you can print it and follow along. Once the list is done, you should have a working EOSIO private blockchain! Gradually I will convert parts of the checklist to automated scripts, this way, it will be quicker and less error prone process to start a new private EOSIO blockchain. That is the vision of eosinabox!
