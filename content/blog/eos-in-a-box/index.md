#Your servers, your EOSIO blockchain.
##Why make a private EOSIO blockchain?

EOS the blockchain and the token are akin to an expensive city. You can develop your dApp on it but you'll pay a premium for the real estate location. You can enjoy the benefits of the EOSIO stack on your very own servers. You already have your servers for regular apps, why not leverage the benefits of a blockchain aimed at developers?

Why not experiment with your very own blockchain and see if you like it?
